Completed Question 1 and Question 2 Part A and B

Created Class Object named SequenceMap 
- Two Private Members were given
- Big Five was default
- Constructor from two strings
- Overload < operator for comparison between the two strings
- Overload << operator to print vectors 
- Merge function was used to combine two SequenceMap vectors

Part 2a
Parser to read DB and contruct AvlTree
- Each line of rebase210.txt is read and place in new SequenceMap
- Added case so if the new_sequence_map.recognition_sequence_ equals 
    the recognition_sequence_ of a node X in the tree it will Merge
- Created a print function in avl_tree.h
- Used new print function to print values of inputs in DB 

Part 2B 
- Parser to read DB and contruct AvlTree
- Each line of rebase210.txt is read and place in new SequenceMap
- Added a function that prints number of nodes in the AvlTree
- Created a function that computes the internal path length
- Completed find function that searches the sequences.txt 
- Finished the remove function that removes every other sequence in sequences.txt
- Redid step 2, 3a, and 3b for sequences.txt

Part 2C
- In progress
